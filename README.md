# CKEditor 4.19.1 for Wolf CMS
Adds a FULL Package of CKEditor with the EMOJI add-on as a WYSIWYG filter to Wolf CMS
Installation instructions
-------------------------
1. Compress / copy any current version of CKEditor
2. Access the Administration panel in Wolf CMS and you should see CKEditor gone
3. Upload the plugin folder to **/wolf/plugins**. Make sure its name is **ckeditor**.
4. In the backend of Wolf CMS, go to **Administration** and enable the CKEditor plugin by checking the checkbox.

CKEditor is now ready to be used! Simply open a page (or create a new one) and select the CKEditor filter. If you have configured CKEditor to be the default filter, new pages will already have CKEditor selected as filter but use this with care - pages with php included will have tags encapsulated in < p > tags.

If you have customized your previous install of CKEditor, those mods will need to be reapplied.
